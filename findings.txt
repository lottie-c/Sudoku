Question 5. 

mystery2.dat contains the board that is impossible to solve.

I have interpreted 'difficulty' as follows. 

  When the program comes to a square there are only so many digits
  that 'make_move' can actually place in said square. The more digits
  that it is possible to place the more difficult the puzzle is. 
  Using this logic I have used the number of times in the
  solve_board() function that the make_move() function
  returns true as a measure of how computationally expensive a puzzle
  is and hence discern its difficulty. 

  I set up a the function solve_board_counter() to return how
  many times make_move() placed a digit; the higher the counter the
  higher the difficulty. The readings from the mystery data files are
  as follows;

  data	  mystery1.dat	mystery3.dat
  reading 421546	14133.

  From this I think that mystery1.dat contains the 'extremely hard'
  puzzle as the counter read 421546.

  Then mystery3.dat contains the 'hard' puzzle, with the counter
  reading 14133.
